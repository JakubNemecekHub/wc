A word is a series of non-whitespace characters surrounded by whitespace characters on both sides.


Normal input = file name/path (test with path) -> create an ifstream for each command
             = multiple names/paths -> create an ifstream for each file and each commant | NOT YET IMPLEMENTED
Piped input = uses cin.
              Somewhere along the way a single new line byte is added at the end of the input. This is expected, do not remove this last byte.
